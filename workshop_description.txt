  [*] Medical items such as poisons, buffs, and healing items now stack to 4.
  [list]
    [*] Bandages and plastiseal still stack to 8.
  [/list]
  [*] Oxygen, oxygenite, welding, and incendium tanks stack to 1. Oxygen sources last twice as long in all diving suits and diving masks to accommodate this change.
  [*] Ammo stacks to various amounts. [list]
    [*] Revolver rounds stack to 24
    [*] Grenades stack to 4
    [*] Shotgun shells stack to 12
    [*] Stun gun darts stack to 6
    [*] Harpoons stack to 6
  [/list]
[/list]

[h2]Weapon Changes[/h2]
Railguns have been significantly buffed. Normal and physicorium shells can now penetrate armour, making it easier to take out bulky enemies like molochs.

Piercing ammo has been nerfed and physicorium ammo has been buffed to make the harder to acquire ammo more powerful.

The alien pistol has been souped up to give it a bit more of a punch.

[h2]Misc[/h2]
Alien artifacts roll less - they shouldn't yeet themselves off cliffs [i]quite[/i] so readily, but they can still roll a bit.

Mechanic jumpsuits now offer lacerations resistance instead of burns resistance, in line with the damage caused by mechanical repairs.

Coilgun ammo can now be combined.

Plastiseal only makes 1 per craft to account for its deconstruction recipe.

Explosive harpoons can now be deconstructed into a harpoon and a C4 block.
