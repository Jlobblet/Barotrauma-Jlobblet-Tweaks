[b]Jlobblet Tweaks[/b] is a collection of changes to vanilla items aimed at adjusting the vanilla balance of power.

[h2]Stacking Changes[/h2]
Several classes of items have been adjusted to stack to different amounts:
[list]
  [*] Medical items such as poisons, buffs, and healing items now stack to 4.
  [*] Oxygen, oxygenite, welding, and incendium tanks stack to 1. Oxygen tanks last twice as long in diving suits and diving masks to accommodate this change/
  [*] Ammo stacks to various amounts. [list]
    [*] Revolver rounds stack to 24
    [*] Grenades stack to 4
    [*] Shotgun shells stack to 18
    [*] Stun gun darts stack to 6
    [*] Harpoons stack to 6
  [/list]
[/list]

[h2]Weapon Changes[/h2]
Railguns have been significantly buffed. Normal and physicorium shells can now penetrate armour, making it easier to take out bulky enemies like molochs.

Piercing ammo has been nerfed and physicorium ammo has been buffed to make the harder to acquire ammo more powerful.

The alien pistol has been souped up to give it a bit more of a punch.
